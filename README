This requires the NI GPIB driver; this repo includes the 32-bit version.
To use it, your compiler must be able to generate and link 32-bit code. It may be possible to link against a 64-bit driver if NI provides one (unknown), but is untested so far.

By default, some 68k code must be compiled (required for main ROM erase and reflash) and therefore requires the appropriate compiler.

To build under Linux:
- edit Makefile, check CC=... line
- "make"

To build under DOS :
- refer to "tfdos" file
- by default *does not* include the ROM reflash kernel
